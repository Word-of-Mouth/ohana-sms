[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/monfresh/ohana-sms.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/monfresh/ohana-sms) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/monfresh/ohana-sms/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/monfresh/ohana-sms)

Ohana SMS is a Ruby on Rails application that allows people in need who lack
access to the internet to find human services via SMS.

By default, Ohana SMS is able to query any [Ohana API][ohana-api] instance,
but it can be modified to work with any API.

## Stack Overview

* Ruby version 2.2.0
* Rails version 4.2.0
* Testing Frameworks: MiniTest

## Local Installation

### Prerequisites
You'll need a Ruby development environment on your computer, and a Twilio account.

#### Ruby
If you're on a Mac, the easiest way to get up and running is to run my
[laptop script](https://github.com/monfresh/laptop). On Linux, you'll need to
install [Build tools][build-tools], [Ruby with RVM][ruby], and [Node.js][node].

Once your environment is ready to go, install the app:

```
git clone git@github.com:monfresh/ohana-sms.git && cd ohana-sms
bin/setup
```

[ruby]: https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Ruby.md
[node]: https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Node.js.md

#### Twilio
1. Sign up for a [free Twilio account](http://twilio.com/try-twilio).
2. Once logged in to your Twilio account, visit the [Account Settings][settings]
page.
3. Copy your Test AccountSID and paste it in `config/application.yml`
next to `twilio_account_sid`.
4. Copy your Test AuthToken and paste it in `config/application.yml`
next to `twilio_auth_token`.
5. Enter your Twilio phone number (including the `+1`) next to `twilio_number`.

## Deploy to Heroku

1. Click this button: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

2. Sign in, or sign up if you don't already have a Heroku account

3. Fill in the `App Name` field with your desired name, such as `ohana-sms-demo`

4. Scroll down and click `Deploy for Free`

5. Once your app is created, go to your computer's command line
and run `figaro heroku:set -e production -a your_app_name`,
where `your_app_name` is the name you chose in step 3.
This will configure your Heroku app with your secret Twilio information
from your `application.yml`.

6. Go to the Twilio [Manage Numbers][manage] page and click on your number.

7. Under `Messaging`, in `Request URL`, enter
`https://ohana-sms-demo.herokuapp.com/locations/reply`, making sure to
replace `ohana-sms-demo` with your actual Heroku app name. Then select
`HTTP GET` from the dropdown, and click `Save`. It should look like this:

## Test the app with your phone

1. Send an SMS to your Twilio number. You should be asked to enter a ZIP code:
   ```
   Hi! Please enter a 5-digit ZIP code to get started.
   ```

2. Send `94025`. You should be offered to choose a category:
   ```
   Please choose a category by entering its number: #1: Care,
   #2: Education...
   ```

3. Send `1`. You should get up to 5 results if there's a match:
   ```
   Here are up to 5 locations that match your search.
   To get more details about a location, enter its number.
   #1: Rosener House Adult Day Services (Peninsula Volunteers)...
   ```
   If there isn't a match, you should get:
   ```
   Sorry, no results found. Please try again with a different ZIP code or category.
   ```

4. Send `1`. You should get more details about Rosener House
(short description, phone, and address).

5. You can now send a different result number to see details about another location.

6. To reset the conversation, send `reset` (it's not case-sensitive).
